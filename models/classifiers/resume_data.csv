"Benny Ogidan 13, Unity Close, Ogudu Road, Ojota, Lagos Email: bo72@kent.ac.uk Phone: 07065144867, 08033323907    Award winning student with a huge passion for developing software applications and responsive design websites. I possess over five years of experience in a variety of development and desktop support roles. Studying has provided me with the opportunity to be employed in roles where I have developed my analytical and research skills. I have been described as an innovative individual who continually self learns and develops himself to be in-line with current technologies (Python, C#, ASP.net, MongoDB). At the moment, I am self-funding a programming course for learning and practicing Ruby, Javascript Python and responsive web design. Studying has made me easily adaptable and interested in learning about new technologies and has exposed me to alternative software packages such as MATLAB, Python and R statistical software. I am able to work in a front-end development, back-end development or a Full-stack development environment with my vast experiences of writing SQL queries for databases.     Education 01/13 - (Present)  University of Kent, Canterbury              Doctor of Philosophy in Psychology (completed in 2016 awaiting viva)   Thesis Title: The influence of the cross race effect on composite production in criminal cases.   Supervisor: Professor R. A Johnston and Dr. David Kelly   My PhD research researched the effect of the cross race effect (where individuals of the same-racial group have difficulty recognizing of other-racial groups) on criminal composites (e.g. sketches in criminal investigations) formed in crime scenarios where individuals of different races are involved. One of the main aims is to formulate a paradigm which law enforcement agencies could adopt during construction of other race composites.   All experiments were made using  web interface (Qualtrics) which required manipulation by using Javascript.  Presentation of stimuli was ordered using Javascript for all participants. Using Cluster sampling individuals were identified and selected for use, each experiment was examined using R statistical software with the help of ANOVAs and printing various graphs to compare means of participant’s scores.   09/10 – 09/11  University of Kent, Canterbury Master of Science in Computing and Entrepreneurship Core Modules:        Advanced Java Programming, Computing Law, Financial and Accounting Management, IT Consultancy Final Project: “Learning Software for Human Faces”    My project aimed to develop a software application using Java programming language that could be used to match faces of a group of individuals with their respective names in human memory. This could be an effective way to prevent individuals forgetting names of people they have been introduced to. An ecological valid application example would be in universities where professors in classes with students would be able to call out students names in their class on meeting them for the first time after using the software or doctors with a limited amount of patients on their wards.     10/02- 07/08  King’s College London (University of London) Bachelor of Engineering in Computer Systems and Electronics with a Year In Industry                Core Modules:  Computer Engineering, Signals and Systems, Introduction to Telecommunication Networks, Compression and Multimedia, Project Management, Mobile and Personal Communications Fourth year project:   “Graffiti representation using an Artificial Neural Network”  Machine learning: My project involved using MATLAB to analyze and manipulate error rates for graffiti used in configuring palmtops. Using the artificial neural network paradigm i was able to develop an effective training and testing algorithm for my project.   The aim was to strive to use neural network encoding system from MATLAB as a tool to generate output on the screen of a palmtop when triggered by various user inputs.   Work History   Professional experience 01/2010 – (Present)  Freelance full-stack developer in C#, ASP.net, SQL and Python                    Projects worked on listed below 01/2012- 07/2012 Kent Information Technology Clinic (University of Kent) Student Mentor / Senior Consultant Recruited to work as a mentor to incoming Master of Science Computing students who had registered for the IT consultancy course.

FEBURARY 2016 – TILL DATE FULL STACK JAVA DEVELOPER    MEDINTELLI Product is certified electronic health records for ambulatory practices. Medintelli Electronic Health Record (EHR) solution makes it easy transition from paper to electronic health records. We provide a complete Electronic Medical Records (EMR) solution that is easy to use with fully integrated Medical Practice Management and patient portal solution. Through the patient portal, patients can securely access their medical records, view test results, pay bills, and schedule appointments from anywhere, at any time via the Internet and create a HIPAA-compliant paperless environment. Patient Health Records (PHR): Manages patients in this module. The patients have full access to their records from this portal. They can schedule/cancel an appointment, view lab records, alerts, medication, prescriptions from this module. Front desk portal: The front desk portal manages different modules. In this module, they can schedule an appointment; check the validation of insurance billing. Doctor portal: The portal is integrated with different modules. The doctor can have the electronic medical records with HIPPA compliance. Doctor can get alert on history, allergies and complication of a patient. From this portal, a secure direct access is provided to transcription portal. Grouping and Matching: With this you can maintain groups. This in turn eases the ability to match the regulations setup by HIPPA. You can create searchable groups and categorize applicants based on your requirements. Smart Communication: Since communication is a key aspect of healthcare process, this system gives you the flexibility of communicating via email, phone, and fax. This piece is tightly integrated with the software and can be invoked and used from very minor use to critical pieces. You can set reminders, send group messages, can send smart responses etc. We have tight integration with PDAs and Smart phones/ devices and give you the flexibility to manage communication with these devices anytime/anywhere.  Compliance & Reporting: You have lots of built in report types that can tell you everything you want to know about your patients, Customers and job order. You also can generate custom reports for any specific purposes. Compliance reports dramatically reduce time spent gathering regulatory information for government and other reporting requirements.
