Team Size: 1 Main project: Spy Communication System Description As we know that in present time internet crime is increasing constantly. There are so many who can easily hack the private or secure conversation or data so it is necessary to make the data secure for transmission. A spy communication system deals with that all. It uses encrptography and steganography to make the data secure. In encryptography the meaningful data is used to be converted in a ciphertext using a pseudo random key which only can be reconstructed into meaningful message using decryption process using the same key used by the sender of the message whereas in steganography the data used to be hidden behind some image file or mp3 or video.So using both the method together the data can be made more secure and undetectable for the transmission specially a private or scientific conversation.

FEBURARY 2016 – TILL DATE FULL STACK JAVA DEVELOPER    MEDINTELLI Product is certified electronic health records for ambulatory practices. Medintelli Electronic Health Record (EHR) solution makes it easy transition from paper to electronic health records. We provide a complete Electronic Medical Records (EMR) solution that is easy to use with fully integrated Medical Practice Management and patient portal solution. Through the patient portal, patients can securely access their medical records, view test results, pay bills, and schedule appointments from anywhere, at any time via the Internet and create a HIPAA-compliant paperless environment. Patient Health Records (PHR): Manages patients in this module. The patients have full access to their records from this portal. They can schedule/cancel an appointment, view lab records, alerts, medication, prescriptions from this module. Front desk portal: The front desk portal manages different modules. In this module, they can schedule an appointment; check the validation of insurance billing. Doctor portal: The portal is integrated with different modules. The doctor can have the electronic medical records with HIPPA compliance. Doctor can get alert on history, allergies and complication of a patient. From this portal, a secure direct access is provided to transcription portal. Grouping and Matching: With this you can maintain groups. This in turn eases the ability to match the regulations setup by HIPPA. You can create searchable groups and categorize applicants based on your requirements. Smart Communication: Since communication is a key aspect of healthcare process, this system gives you the flexibility of communicating via email, phone, and fax. This piece is tightly integrated with the software and can be invoked and used from very minor use to critical pieces. You can set reminders, send group messages, can send smart responses etc. We have tight integration with PDAs and Smart phones/ devices and give you the flexibility to manage communication with these devices anytime/anywhere.  Compliance & Reporting: You have lots of built in report types that can tell you everything you want to know about your patients, Customers and job order. You also can generate custom reports for any specific purposes. Compliance reports dramatically reduce time spent gathering regulatory information for government and other reporting requirements.

ACADEMIC PROJECT: Project Title: TOWER CRANE Description:  A crane is  a  type  of machine,  generally  equipped  with  a  hoist  rope, wire ropes or chains, and sheaves, that can be used both to lift and lower materials and to move them horizontally. It is mainly used for lifting heavy things and transporting them to other places. The device uses one or more  simple machines to create mechanical advantage  and thus move loads beyond the normal capability of a human. Cranes are commonly employed in  the transport industry  for  the  loading  and  unloading  of  freight,  in the construction industry for the movement of materials, and in the manufacturing industry for the assembling of  heavy equipment. Project Title: FLY WHEEL Description:  A flywheel is a mechanical device specifically designed to efficiently store rotational  energy. Flywheels  resist changes  in rotational  speed by their  moment  of inertia.  The  amount  of  energy  stored  in  a  flywheel  is  proportional  to  the  square  of its rotational  speed.  The  way  to  change  a  flywheel  stored  energy  is  by  increasing  or decreasing its rotational speed applying a  torque aligned with its axis of symmetry. ACHIEVEMENTS / CO-CURRICULAR ACTIVITIES / EXTRA CURRICULAR ACTIVITIES: Auto CAD And Pro/E Certificate. Bharat Vikash Parishad Certificate.
